# Data Science with C# and ML.NET (v2)

![Data Science with C# and ML.NET](./assets/DSC.jpg)

This repository contains all course assignments of my **Data Science with C# and ML.NET** course and will get you up to speed with Microsoft's new ML.NET library.

By working through the code examples, you will learn how to design, train, and evaluate complex AI models with simple C# code. I'll provide you with all the code, libraries, and data sets you need to get started.

Please note that this repository only contains code examples with no additional support.
